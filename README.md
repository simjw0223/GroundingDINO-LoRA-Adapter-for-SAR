# 🛰️ GroundingDINO + LoRA Adapter for SAR Ship Detection

This repository provides **LoRA-based adapter weights** for specializing the original  
[Grounding DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO) model for  
**SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) ship detection**.

The goal of this project is to **retain Grounding DINO’s open-set, text-prompt-guided detection capability**  
while adapting it to the unique characteristics of SAR images such as **speckle noise, low contrast,  
and grayscale representation**.

## 🔍 Key Features

- 🚀 Lightweight and parameter-efficient fine-tuning with **LoRA**
- 📡 Focused on **ship detection in SAR imagery**
- 🧩 Fully compatible with the **original Grounding DINO inference pipeline**
- 🔍 Supports **natural language detection prompts** (e.g., _"ship"_, _"vessel"_)
